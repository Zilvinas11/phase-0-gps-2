What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Merge confilcts. I was confused by a lot of material that was out there which made it seem that it was a lot harder then it was.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
merge confilc and Github workflow. Before this assignment I understood a how to fallow directions, but did not know why I had to do it and why I could not do things other ways. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
About the Merge Confilc and GitHub.. IT is hard to remember because it was more a conversation then a Q and A session.


What still confuses you about Git?
Not sure if I have questions at this point. I will know once I come across a chellenge...

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I think I am still getting used to dynamics surrounding web sessions. I think I could have used thechniques provided (pair to pair intro) a little better.
