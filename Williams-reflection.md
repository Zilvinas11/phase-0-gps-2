# Thoughts from my first GPS session

1. I struggled with keeping the idea of difference between Git on my local computer and Github.

2. The workflow involved with working with another person. In the past when I had used Git and Github is was on personal projects so pulling changes from Github wasn't as important.

3. I asked why git init is not needed after I cloned my pairs repository.

4. The collaborative workflow is new to me but since we'll be using it so much I think I just need a little repetition.

5. It was nice having someone there to clarify things if we were unsure what the module was asking. He also provided some insight on how these concepts work in a production environment. Practical examples are one of the best ways that I learn so that definitly helped.
